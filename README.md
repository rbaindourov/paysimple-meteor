# paysimple-meteor

Meteor 1.2 Project to integrate with paysimple using ES5.
Make sure to replace username and secret code in settings.json file to match your account.

My employer requested that I recreate a simple accounts settled report page for our internal network.
I decided to do it in Meteor 1.2 and open source it as an example.
